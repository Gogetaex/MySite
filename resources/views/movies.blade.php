      So movies have been an instrumental part of my development, and have helped shape a lot of my beliefs. Often times, they really are just there to pass time and be entertaining, but occasionally, someone makes a movie that actually has something to say. These are the ones I really, really recommend.

      <h2>The Breakfast Club (1985)</h2>
       <p>
       One of the absolute best movies of all time. This means so much to me because it helped me get inside the heads of those around me. I saw it when I was sixteen and in the middle of my high school career, and the change it made was like night and day.
       I absolutely believe that every teenager should be required by law to watch this movie before going into high school. It shows that we're all going through the same struggles, and helps create empathy within the people watching. Each character felt so real to me and over the course of the movie,
       I felt like I'd made five new friends. A lot of who I am comes from having seen this movie.

      <h2>Your Name (2016)</h2>
       <p>
        First of all, Your Name is one of the most gorgeous movies I've ever seen. It tells a story about that feeling you get when you wake up from a dream, and barely remember what you dreampt about. I've never been able to put into words what nearly everyone feels as well as
        this movie is able to do it. I remember driving two and a half hours to see it just so I could support the industry in bringing these movies to the big screen for us. It made me tear up twice, and I have watched it so many times since. It's the first movie to top 
        Spirited Away in any way, and it blew those sales out of the water. I was excited for nearly a year after it came out in Japan before I finally got to see it locally, because I was stubborn, and refused to see it in anything outside of theatres for the first time, 
        and boy oh boy was I not disappointed.

      <h2>Ferris Buller's Day Off (1986)</h2>
       <p>
        This is a movie that didn't really teach me anything, but it's an absolute fun time that is so infectious, anyone can get caught up in it. Saw it for the first time with my old man around the same time I saw The Breakfast Club. It didn't exactly leave a mark in any sort of
        meaningful way, but it's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.

      <h2>Wreck-It Ralph (2012)</h2>
       <p>
        You never really go into a children's movie expecting it to have a profound impact on you. Most people from my generation were already sold on Wreck-It Ralph simply because of what it was about, and the cameos we knew we'd be seeing.
        I went into it excited to see Disney make a movie that would hopefully be as good as a Pixar film, and I left tearing up over a beautiful credits song by Owl City, a life lesson about loving myself, and a legitimately great movie that 
        taught me lessons I still use today.

        Robin Williams motivating a class of kids to seize the day. It was shown to me in high school, and I really feel like this one speaks for itself.

      <h2>Wolf Children (2012)</h2>
       <p>
        Mamoru Hasoda is a Japanese director who's directed several films, and this one is, in my opinion, by far his best. I don't even remember what made me put it on, but it hit me emotionally in the first few minutes harder than many movies hit me over their entire runtime, much like Up did.
        I don't want to say too much about the movie because it'd be very spoilery, but this is a great series for anyone who enjoys a slow paced character study that has no 'antagonist' other than the day to day getting through life, which is something we all face.

      <h2>Pixar (1995-)</h2>
       <p>
        So Pixar is up there as one of the greatest studios ever made, and I personally think they're probably the most consistent studio to put out films. It's at the point with them that if I find out Pixar's name is on something, that's good enough for me to go ahead and claim 
        it as a masterpiece without ever having seen it. Every single movie that Pixar has put out has just been top notch, with Coco really blowing me away recently. Their understanding of, well, cinema outrivals all their competition and then some. Their movies don't always teach me a 
        life lesson, but they do always leave me feeling like a more fulfilled individual.

      <h2>Marvel Cinematic Universe (2008-)</h2>
       <p>
        The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an interesting and unique series of films. It's the first time in cinema history that a project this massive has come together, and it's coming together quite nicely. 
        Those in charge have managed to create nearly twenty movies that all tie into one another, where each character still feels like they get their own time to shine and don't rely on previous knowledge of 
        the source material to still have a great viewing experience. I've never kept up with comic books or anything like that, and I thoroughly enjoy this, which is one of the most impressive parts of the universe they've built.''
