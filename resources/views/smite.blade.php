          Smite is from the genre most people call "MOBA" which stands for Multiple Online Battle Arena, otherwise known as the place hopes and dreams go to die. It's basically a five versus five team game where each player gets to pick a character (or in Smite, gods) 
          that has (usually) four different moves, with the objective of taking over the enemy's base. Other popular MOBAs would be League of Legends and DOTA 2. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I found the game early 2014 when a friend who was staying with me showed it to me, and I jumped in along with other friends absolutely full force, and it wasn't too long before we were able to start playing ranked. I was actually terrible when I started, 
          as I tend to be. After finally becoming less hard-headed about how I was doing things, and listened to other people giving me advice, I started to get better and climbed the ranks. There's also a 1v1 mode that I fell in love with because it meant I didn't
          have to count on anyone else and any mistake that was made was my own. I actually got to top ten in the world MMR wise at one point in this mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          I eventually got to a very high rank in the main mode, Conquest, as well. This is around the time where I was looking for a semi-professional team to join, and when I finally found one, it was an amazing feeling, because every second on the game felt like
          practice towards something greater. I was incredibly excited. Some time and a few losses later, I decided to put the game down, because my family and friends had told me that it was becoming 'too much.' Even so, it's a great game and I'm happy with the time 
          I put into it.

      <h2>Scylla</h2>
      <p>
        So I mained midlane, which is predominantly a role dominated by mages. Of those mages, Scylla was my favorite god by far. She came out shortly after I started taking the game more seriously, and people started taking notice.
        Once I joined a real team, we started practicing against other teams, and part of each game is banning gods that aren't allowed to be picked, and it was quite a common occurrance for people to ban Scylla, not because she was
        too particularly good, but because it just wasn't worth letting me have her. Still definitely one of my favorite characters to play in any game ever.

      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        So Mercury was my primary God for 1v1's, and I actually barely played him outside of that. He had a very strong ability to play 1v1, and Scylla was one of the worst characters in the mode, so it was only natural to play someone else. What's comincal, though,
        is that he's based on going very fast, and even has references to Sonic, who is my main in Smash games. He's a late game god who if you don't stop him early, is going to run everyone over. That's part of why I liked him. He was hard to play in the start, 
        but by being smart, everything would usually end up going my way.

      <h2>He Bo</h2>
      <p>
        Much like in Conquest, bans were also available for 1v1. If Mercury got banned, I had to have another character that I was able to play, and that was He Bo. He was basically a burst mage who was able to unload all of his abilities very quickly, and is often
        called a glass cannon. He has no way of really escaping from bad situations other than "kill the thing threatening me before it kills me." He was a bit higher in the 'risk vs reward' department than I tend to enjoy playing, which is why he was more my secondary
        than my main character to play. Even still, I hold him near and dear to my heart, and I probably couldn't have climbed as high in the ranks as I did without him.
